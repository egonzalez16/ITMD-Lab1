<h1>My First Header</h1>
  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>My name is Emmanuel Gonzalez and I am a fourth year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science. I chose computer science because ever since I was in highschool my favorite classes were my computer science classes and I haven't looked back since. I like watching movies and enjoy playing games in my spare time. </p>
